# bpmlm
C++ model of Binary Plan Multi-Level Marketing (BPMLM).

## Background
A binary plan is an organizational structure used in multi-level marketing (MLM) organizations. In this structure, new members are introduced into a system with a tree-like structure where each “node” or new member of the organization has a left and right sub-tree. Binary plans began to be introduced by MLM companies in the late 1980s and became one of the four most common organizational structures by the early 2000s.

## Purpose
Using this model one can simulate the model given the product line of the company. The results provided by this simulator can give you an idea on how much money you can make in the organization.
